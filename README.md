# KillSpawnEgg

- Everytime you kill a mob/animal for each spawn egg exists - you get the spawn egg! 
- For example: if you kill a pig, you get the pig spawn egg 
- The purpose of this plugin is to introduce something new - are you capable of collecting all spawn eggs possible? Do you want to efficiently create some animal/mob farm? 
That's the plugin for you!
